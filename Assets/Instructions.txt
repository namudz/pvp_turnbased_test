Welcome to the Senior Dev Test :)

In this project we want you to create the proof of concept of a hypothetical game. This means we have a grand vision of what the game will be in the future, but for now, we only need the bare minimum to see the fun of it.

What we want to have for the proof of concept is a scene where the combat part of the game will take place.
The game should ultimately be a turn based PvP game, but for the proof of concept consider a local multiplayer in the likes of pass-n-play where one player places their actions first, pass along the phone to the other player which places their actions and then the game executes both actions.

Game Rules:
- Each player has 2 heroes. 
- Each hero can only execute 1 action per turn.
- Heroes have 3 possible actions: move, attack, and use a special ability.
- The game will execute actions simultaneously for both players following the order:
	- Movement
	- Special Attack
	- Attack
- Each turn happens in following order:
	- Both players will first define what each hero will do on their turn (move, attack or use special).
	- Then the game will move any heroes that was assigned a move action.
	- Then the game will execute the special abilities for heroes that selected special ability.
	- Then the game will execute attacks for the heroes that didn't move and didn't execute a special ability.
	- Finally the game will evaluate which heroes are dead and remove them from the game.
- The game ends when any player is without heroes.

Actions:
	- Movement:
		All heroes movement is physics based and uses a slingshot mechanic to define the velocity
	- Attack:
		There are 2 possible types of attack:
		- Melee attack for close combat
		- Ranged attack with a projectile		
	- Special Attack:
		There are 3 possible:
		- Heal friendly unit in range
		- Pull opponents closer 
		- Push opponents away

Characters:
	Otto:
	- Can pull opponents
	- Melee attack

	Clay:
	- No special abilities
	- Melee attack

	Alice:
	- Can heal friendly units
	- Ranged attack

	Gretchen:
	- Can push opponents
	- Ranged attack
	

The test shouldn't take longer than 8 hours, but you are free to use more time if you want. 
We just ask you to inform us how many hours were put into the test.

We included in the project:
	- Assets for the heroes including their animations
	- Assets for the combat scene
	- Basic UI for health tracking
	- Addressables package is included
	- TextMeshPro Essentials
	- Unity Project is setup in a basic way using URP with Unity 2020.3.0f1

We will focus our evaluation in the code quality, scalability, flexibility and performance. 
We expect you to implement feedback to the player when necessary.
Any polish in the game visuals is nice but not really required.

When you are done, please send us your source code (via GitHub or any other online repository) so that we can make a code review.
Please also attach a README.md document in which you'll mention
    - The time it took you to perform the exercise
    - The parts that were difficult for you and why
    - The parts you think you could do better and how
    - What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
    - Any comment you may have
